# Software for Delay Systems (SSD) - Coming soon

SSD is a MATLAB package providing the following features and functions for retarded time delay systems:
- **Time and frequency domain visualizations:** step, bode, bodemag, sigma, nyquist.
- **Position Balanced Reduction:** gram, balreal, balred (standard and frequency-limited).
- **H2 norm computation:** h2norm.

In addition, this repo includes **two executable notebooks, benchmarks_model_reduction.mlx and benchmarks_h2norm.mlx** collecting benchmark problems for model reduction and H2 norm computation for delay systems. 

## Installation
Add src [src](src)  directory to the MATLAB's path.
